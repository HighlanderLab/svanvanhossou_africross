# Simulation of cattle genome & founder populations

# This part of simulation with runMacs() and repeat {} is quite slow!
# There are two options one can take regarding runMacs():
# 1) Save the simulated founder genomes and load them in the next run
#    (only for testing purposes - we want variation between replicates)
# 2) Use the quickHaplo() function to speed up the simulation
#    (only for testing purposes - it does not generate properly structured genomes)

# ---- Simulate Founders genome ----

# We can speed this up by saving founder genomes and loading them instead
# Beware, we must however resimulate founder genomes for each replicate!
